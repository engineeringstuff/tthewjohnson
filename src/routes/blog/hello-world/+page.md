# Why I Decided to Start a New Blog
As someone who has been involved in technology for over 20 years, I've had various websites and side-projects over that period of time. I even had a very popular blog at one point in time with over 500,000 views per month. But, I gave up on that since it didn't yield the career or monetary benefits that I expected. Looking back, I realize this decision was probably selfish and short-sighted.

So, I decided to start a new blog ðŸŽ‰ that I'm moderately excited about. On here, I intend to post general musings, opinions, observations, and some technical content too.

## Choosing the Right Tools
This blog is built with SvelteKit, hosted on CloudFlare Pages, and the design is based on [this template](https://github.com/mdrathik/nuxtjs-tailwind-blog) - which is an odd choice because it's intended for Nuxt. Initially, this blog started out as a Nuxt project. However, the `@nuxt/content` plugin appeared to be unable to pre-render markdown into static files at the time of creation. At the time, my son had a SvelteKit-based side-project, so I decided to give it a try, and I've been pleasantly surprised by the experience.

## Where to Find the Source Code

I'm excited to see where this new blogging adventure takes me, and I hope you'll join me for the ride.
